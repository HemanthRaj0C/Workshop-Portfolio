              I'm a passionate Cybersecurity student at Chennai Institute of Technology, currently 
              pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity. My 
              curiosity about ethical hacking, network security, and digital forensics drives my 
              continuous learning in this ever-evolving field.

              My journey in cybersecurity began with a fascination for understanding how systems work 
              and how to protect them from threats. I actively participate in CTF (Capture The Flag) 
              competitions, bug bounty programs, and contribute to open-source security tools. These 
              experiences have sharpened my skills in penetration testing, cryptography, and 
              vulnerability assessment.

              Beyond technical skills, I enjoy mentoring junior students in cybersecurity fundamentals, 
              helping them get started with ethical hacking and secure coding practices. I also engage 
              in hackathons, collaborate on security research projects, and stay updated with the 
              latest industry trends through online courses and certifications.

              When I'm not immersed in cybersecurity, youâ€™ll find me exploring emerging tech trends, 
              writing about security best practices, or brainstorming innovative ways to strengthen 
              digital defenses. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a safer digital world by bridging 
              the gap between security awareness and implementation.
